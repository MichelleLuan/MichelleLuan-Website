I am Michelle Luan. 18 year old, 2 weeks left till I am 19. I was born in Taiwan, and was also raised there for around 13 years. I then moved to the U.S after I graduated from elementary school. Till now, I have been living in the United States for almost 7 years, and I know that I will continue to live in the United States for the rest of my life, so I started to look for what I want to pursue as my future career. What I have figured out is to be an interior designer, unfortunately the University I applied for interior design has rejected me. I later decided to major in film and theatre digital production in UCR. Even though UCR does not have interior design, I think it would also be great if I can start from stage design in the major I am currently in. 
	As a freshman in the University, I was not able to take upper division class for stage design, but through the regular major courses, I have found out that filming and editing are also very interesting. Honestly I have loved doing editing since middle school. Whenever I have a video project, I will always put 100% effort into making a perfect video. Through the classes I have taken so far, I have learned more ways and techniques to edit the videos. Aside from video editing, I also found myself very interested in filming, lighting and sounds production. These categories are much more interesting after I decided to concentrate on filming. 
	After I chose filming as my concentration I have always tried to learn some other techniques by myself, since the school campus is closed due to the COVID-19. Even though I got less chances to actually engage with filming, lighting or sounding, I decided to improve on my editing skills. On my boring quarantine days I love to watch Youtube videos, I would watch categories such as vlogs, tv shows, short films, music videos and such… And I would go research on how different kinds of videos are made. The editing programs are all different depending on the quality and how professional it is. I would then try to download the editing programs such as the one I always see, called Premiere Pro. Back then I always used iMovie to edit my videos and never found out that Premiere Pro allows me to work on more details such as subtitles, light, images. From what I have learned Premier Pro is a lot harder, but I felt improved by learning how to use it. 
	Till now, I put more efforts on filming and editing, but what I mainly want to work on is stage design. Since I was very little, I love to DIY things out of paper and other materials. I have made my own wallet and bags from paper. The habit continues today. I have taken 3D design classes in my high school and I fell in love with it. I love building little things, and now I am slowly going towards building bigger things out of my hands.
